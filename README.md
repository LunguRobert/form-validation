# Form Validation

This is a simple form validation built using React and class components. The form includes 5 fields: `username`, `email`, `birthday`, `password`, and `confirm password`. These fields are essential for creating an account or signing up on any website. 

## Background 
The form features a visually appealing background using `react-tsparticles`. It's a library that allows you to add a particle background to your website easily. The background adds an aesthetic touch to the form and makes it more engaging for the user.

## Form Requirements
- `Username`: 3-16 characters, no special characters allowed. This requirement ensures that the username is easy to remember and not too long.
- `Password`: 8-20 characters, must include at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number, and one special character. This requirement ensures that the password is strong and secure.

### Additional Features
-  Input fields will turn red if the input is invalid. This feature provides immediate feedback to the user, letting them know if their input is valid or not.
-  A message will appear below the input fields if the input is invalid. This feature provides more detailed information on what's wrong with the input.
-  A submit button will only be enabled if all the fields are valid. This feature prevents the form from being submitted if there are any errors.
-  Form will only be submitted if all the fields are valid. This feature ensures that the form is only submitted if all the required fields are filled in correctly.

## Usage
-  Clone or download the repository.
